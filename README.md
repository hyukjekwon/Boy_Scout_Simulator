## MAP - Jared Starman
### MAP ORGANIZATION
The Map is divided into 4 sections
#### Tile 1/Tutorial
This section is where the player starts. They learn the basics of orineteering, with lightposts teaching them how to do it properly

#### Tile 2 - Forest
This section is for the players to do the orienteering between three objectives. They interact with radios to update their instructions

#### Tile 3 - Airport
In this section, players must press each of the 4 objectives (the trucks in the hangars and the plane). They also learn how to deal with the three times of animals

#### Tile 4 - Mountain
This is the final section, where players need to do both at the same time
